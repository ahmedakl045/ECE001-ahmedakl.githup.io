<h2> A table shows how artificial intelligence will change the world in future </h2>
<table style="width:100%">
  <tr>
    <th>Industry or Usage Context (specific firm or AI application)</th>
    <th>Description</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>AI in driverless cars (e.g., Tesla)</td>
    <td>In the future, AI-enabled cars may allow for car journeys without any driver input, with the potential to significantly impact various industries (e.g., insurance, taxi services) and customer behaviors (e.g., whether they still buy cars)</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Online retailing AI (e.g., Birchbox)</td>
    <td>AI will enable better predictions for what customers want, which may cause firms to move away from a shopping-then-shipping business model and toward a shipping-then-shopping business model</td>
  </tr>
  <td>Fashion-related AI (e.g., Stitch Fix)</td>
    <td>AI applications support stylists, who curate a set of clothing items for customers. Stitch Fixâ€™s AI analyzes both numeric and image/other non-numeric data.</td> 
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Business process AI (e.g., IBM Interact)</td>
    <td>AI used for multiple (simple) applications, such as customized offers (e.g., Bank of Montreal).</td>
