Artificial intelligence is a branch of computer science that attempts to understand the essence of intelligence and produce a new intelligent machine that responds in a manner similar to human intelligence. Research in this area includes robotics, speech recognition, image recognition, Natural language processing and expert systems
	Theory and technology have become more and more advanced since the advent of artificial intelligence, and the areas of application have grown. It is possible that in the future the technical goods carried with them by artificial intelligence will be the "shell" of human information. Artificial intelligence can simulate human consciousness and thinking about the information process
	Artificial intelligence is not human intelligence, but it can be as human intellect, and it can surpass the intelligence of man. Often referred to as "powerful AI, complete AI or the ability of a computer to perform "general intelligent action." Academic sources reserve "solid AI" for reference to devices that can experience consciousness.
      <h3>History of Artificial Intelligence</h3>
	Artificial Intelligence ( AI) history started in the antiquity, with myths , stories and rumors of artificial beings created by master craftsmen with intellect or consciousness. Classical philosophers planted the seeds of modern AI, who sought to explain the mechanism of human thought as the computational manipulation of symbols.
	This research resulted in the 1940s invention of the programmable digital computer, a system based on the mathematical reasoning's abstract nature. This system and the concepts behind it motivated a group of scientists to start discussing the prospect
	of creating an artificial brain seriously.The field of AI research was developed during the summer of 1956 at a workshop held on the Dartmouth College campus.Those who attended would become the pioneers in AI research for decades. Some of them believed that a computer as intelligent as a human being would exist in no more than a century and millions of dollars were given to make this dream a reality
         <h3>The birth of artificial intelligence 1952–1956</h3>
	In the 1940s and 50s, a handful of scientists from a variety of fields (mathematics, psychology, engineering, economics and political science) began to discuss the possibility of creating an artificial brain. The field of artificial intelligence research was founded as an academic discipline in 1956.A confluence of ideas that became popular in the late 1930s, 1940s and early 1950s influenced the earliest work into thinking machines. Recent neurology studies has shown that the brain was an electrical neuron network that exploded in pulses of all-or-nothing. Cybernetics by Norbert Wiener described control and stability in power grids
	In 1950 Alan Turing published a landmark paper in which he speculated on the possibility of creating machines that think.40 He noted that his famous Turing Test was hard to define and devised thinking. If a computer was able to carry on a conversation (through a teleprinter) that was indistinguishable from a human conversation, then it was fair to assume that the computer was thinking
	Christopher Strachey wrote a checkers system using the University of Manchester's Ferranti Mark 1 computer in 1951, and Dietrich Prinz wrote one for the chess. The checkers system of Arthur Samuel, established in the middle 50s and early 60s, gradually gained enough expertise to challenge a respectable amateur. Game AI will continue to be used as a indicator of AI development throughout its entire existence.
	Marvin Minsky, John McCarthy and two senior scientists had coordinated the 1956 Dartmouth Conference: IBM's Claude Shannon and Nathan Rochester. The conference proposal contained this assertion: "Every aspect of learning or some other function of intelligence can be defined so accurately that it can be rendered to simulate a computer.The participants included Ray Solomonoff, Oliver Selfridge, Trenchard More, Arthur Samuel, Allen Newell and Herbert A. Simon, all of whom would create important programs during the first decades of AI research.At the conference Newell and Simon debuted the "Logic Theorist" and McCarthy persuaded the attendees to accept "Artificial Intelligence" as the name of the field.
	there were development in this field until AI from 1993-2011
          <h3>AI 1993–2011</h3>
	The AI field, now over half a century old, has at last achieved some of its oldest goals. It began to be used widely in the technology industry, although somewhat behind the scenes. Some of the success was attributed to increased computing capacity, and others were accomplished by concentrating on particular isolated problems and addressing them with the highest scientific integrity criteria.
	On 11 May 1997, Deep Blue became the first computer chess-playing machine to defeat a reigning world chess champion, Garry Kasparov. The super computer was a modified variant of a design developed by IBM, and was able to perform twice as many moves per second as it had during the first match (which Deep Blue had lost), approximately 200,000,000 moves per second.
