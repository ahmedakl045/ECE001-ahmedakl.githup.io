<h2>Hospitals and medicine</h2>	
	Artificial neural networks are used as clinical decision support systems for medical diagnosis, such as in Concept Processing technology in EMR software.

 Other tasks in medicine that can potentially be performed by artificial intelligence and are beginning to be developed include:

 Computer-aided interpretation of medical images. Such systems help scan digital images, e.g. from computed tomography, for typical appearances and to highlight conspicuous sections, such as possible diseases. A typical application is the detection of a tumor.
 Heart sound analysis
 Companion robots for the care of the elderly
 Mining medical records to provide more useful information.
 Design treatment plans.
 Assist in repetitive jobs including medication management.
 Provide consultations.
 Drug creation
 Using avatars in place of patients for clinical training
 Predict the likelihood of death from surgical procedures
 Predict HIV progression
<h2>Education</h2>
	AI tutors could allow for students to get extra, one-on-one help. They could also reduce anxiety and stress for some students, that may be caused by tutor labs or human tutors.[21] In future classrooms, ambient informatics can play a beneficial role. Ambient informatics is the idea that information is everywhere in the environment and that technologies automatically adjust to your personal preferences. Study devices could be able to create lessons, problems, and games to tailor to the specific student's needs, and give immediate feedback.
        But AI can also create a disadvantageous environment with revenge effects, if technology is inhibiting society from moving forward and causing negative, unintended effects on society.[23] An example of a revenge effect is that the extended use of technology may hinder studentsâ€™ ability to focus and stay on task instead of helping them learn and grow.Also, AI has been known to lead to the loss of both human agency and simultaneity.
